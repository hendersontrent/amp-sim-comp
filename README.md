# amp-sim-comp
Compares various guitar amp simulators on their quantitative characteristics.

## Motivation

Many different virtual guitar amplifier simulators exist today. While most musicians and producers *tonally* understand the differences between the characteristics of different amplifiers, little research has been conducted on empirical, quantitative differences between them. This projects seeks to address that gap.

## Included Amplifiers

Currently, analysis includes the following amplifiers which I have paid for:

* Archetype Nolly (Neural DSP) - 4 amplifiers
* Fortin Nameless (Neural DSP) - 1 amplifier
* STL Tonality Will Putney (STL) - 5 amplifiers with 3-4 tube settings for each
